QUICK PLAY GUIDE:

Start with all switches down.

The display will read 'PL 1' for a couple seconds and then go blank.

When displays turn off Player 1 uses switches and buttons to enter their digits.

When all four buttons are assigned Player 1 turns switch 4 to high.

When switch 4 goes high the displays show 'PL 2' for a couple of seconds then go blank.

When displays go off Player 2 uses switches and buttons to enter their guess.

To enter initial guess Player 2 must flip switch 5 high and then low to register the guess.

If not correct the displays will show '2 Hi' or '2 LO' until switch 5 goes high again to input a new guess (may be slight delay before switching back to guess input).

After initial guess Player 2 turns switch 5 high to enter a new guess and then low to check that guess until they guess correctly.

Once correct LEDs will flash and the number of guesses will show on the displays.





HOW TO PLAY:

Start the game with all switches down.When powered on, the displays will show 'PL 1' for a couple of seconds and then go blank.Once the displays turn off Player One can input their number for each button by using switches 3-0 and pressing whichever button they'd like that number assigned to. The numbers input for each button will be displayed above that button.After assigning a number to each of the four buttons Player One must turn switch 4 to the high position to indicate they are done and make it Player 2's turn.When switch 4 is changed to high the display will show 'PL 2' for a couple seconds and then turn off.When the displays are off again Player 2 can use switches 3-0 to make guesses for each of the 4 buttons. As they press the buttons their guess for each one will show on the display above it.When Player 2 has made a guess for each button and wants to see if they have guessed correctly, for the initial guess they must move switch 5 to high and then back down to low to lock in the guess. (After the initial guess when switch 5 is high Player 2 is able to input a new guess, when switch 5 is low the guess is being checked and the displays are showing "2 HI/2 LO/number of guesses" depending on the previous guess)- If the guess is too high or too low the display will show '2 HI' or '2 LO' and Player 2 must turn switch 5 back to high again to enter another guess. Once switch 5 is high again it will show Player 2's last guess and they can use the switches and buttons to enter new guesses for each button. When they are ready to submit another guess Player 2 flips switch 5 back to low and the process will repeat until they guess correctly.- If the guess is correct all 8 LEDs will flash and the displays will show the number of guesses it took for Player 2 to guess Player 1's input.
